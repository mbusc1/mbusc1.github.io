						<h2>Why Hire Maddie?</h2>
						<p>I like to get straight to the point: why should you hire me? What sets me apart from other potential candidates? This how I would sum it up:</p>
						<div class="features">
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
								<h3>Extensive coding knowledge</h3>
								<p> UC Irvine's Informatics Major (5 years), Work (3 Years) and my own personal tinkering have taught me not just coding languages, but how to learn coding languages. I also know a lot about the software development process and technology in general. You can see a full list of all my experience on my resume.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-dna"></span>
								<h3>Adaptability</h3>
								<p>I'm always willing to learn and test new frameworks, dig through the documentation, and get right into work. I can say with confidence that I can learn and use whatever langauge is necessary, because I have strong knowledge of object oriented programming fundamentals.</p>
							</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-user-friends"></span>
								<h3>User Focus</h3>
								<p>As part of my work as a web applications developer, and as part of my studies in Human Computer Interaction, I have a strong focus on creating readable code and usable software. I also feel very confident in my ability to perform QA to ensure a high level of quality in my work.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-palette"></span>
								<h3>Appreciation for art and design</h3>
								<p>Good design and aesthetic I find essential to making a polished, professional product. When I code, I keep the whole project in mind and work with design and project management teams to create polished work.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-link"></span>
								<h3>Team Player</h3>
								<p>I love to socialize, chat with people, and work together on projects. Don't believe me? Ask me for an in person or phone interview!</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon major fa-gem"></span>
								<h3>Passionate</h3>
								<p>Programming and Gaming are what I truly love to work on and create, and I will always give 100% to what I am passionate about.</p>
